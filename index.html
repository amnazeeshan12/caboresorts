      <li><strong>Balance Rest and Activities:</strong> While the resort will offer endless entertainment, schedule downtime so children don't get overwhelmed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Best Time to Visit Cabo</h2>
    <p>Cabo enjoys sunny weather nearly year-round. Winter and early spring (December to April) are especially popular because of pleasant temperatures and the chance to see migrating whales.
